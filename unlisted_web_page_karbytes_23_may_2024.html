<p>Last night after going on a moderately vigorous hike in the wilderness northeast of Lake Chabot near where I live in Castro Valley, California and luxuriating in the scenic splendor of the full moon rising in the east amidst the sprawling hills partially or fully covered with oak trees, I felt a bit nauseous as though I was starting to feel the effects of some kind of stomach flu after eating contaminated food. Only in moments in which I seem to be in sufficient physical discomfort to not be able to partake in my normal activities do I start to get very honest with myself about how I really feel about the intrinsic value I expect to feel as a result of continuing to live through extremely physically or psychologically painful circumstances that I think would take up a sufficiently large percentage of my remaining lifespan as the humanoid I currently am and have, at this time, recall myself as only ever having consciously existed as. I felt straightforward and resolute about preferring to die in order to escape suffering which I think would (a) take up too much of my remaining lifespan and (b) cause me so much suffering that I honestly could not say that such experiences are worth having. </p>
<p>Last night&#8217;s morbid confession felt like me being unusually honest with myself due to the simplicity and peaceful solitude of my surrounding environment and the &#8220;crippling&#8221; degree of physical discomfort I was experiencing which felt like the onset of violent food poisoning. My typically high energy level, euphoria, and perfectionism seemed inaccessible to me during that brief period of physical illness and caused me to drop the pretenses that I needed to be a particularly high achiever whose achievements are globally recognized and handsomely compensated with money, praise, and being &#8220;immortalized&#8221; in humanity&#8217;s historical records as one of the most influential thinkers throughout all human civilization. During that brief humbling window, I felt unusually and refreshingly down to earth and content to merely seek and attain comfort for the remainder of my lifespan.</p>
<p>Also during that window of humility and honesty, I contemplated the possibility that the universe I appeared to myself to be living inside of could be a computer simulation set in motion by human developers who intercepted human civilization&#8217;s evolutionary timeline by writing themselves into that simulation such that the simulation appears to have existed prior to humans emerging within that simulation. That seems possible if all of reality is a single ubiquitous, irreducible, and featureless field of consciousness which conjures up any <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">phenomena</a> (because such a reality would essentially be a computational device through which universe simulations are rendered and experienced consciously or semi-consciously by localized partitions of consciousness bundled up inside of finite space-time-matter-energy containers).</p>
<p>I also thought about how I might either get to consciously live for exactly one lifetime (whose duration is finite or infinite) or that I might be forced to reincarnate each time I die (and perhaps also be forced to die within a finite amount of time per lifetime I live). I thought about how I would probably rather stop consciously existing forever after I die in this lifetime than be forced to reincarnate into a new body and lifespan which is hellish compared to my current incarnation. I thought about how, if I am forced to die within a finite time period of being incarnated (yet be forced to reincarnate infinitely many times), I might be able to honestly assess that a sufficiently large enough percentage of all my conscious experiences across all of my lifetimes is worthwhile for me to experience instead of what I deem to be not worth experiencing. Then again, it is hard for me to assess what that ratio is given that I do not seem to have access to knowledge my alternate (i.e. past, future, or concurrent) incarnations have because I seem to be limited to knowing only what is my solipsistic experience within the current incarnation I am inhabiting (though I could be wrong and may at times be able to access memories or universes which seem to exist outside the bounds of the current incarnation or universe I am inhabiting (and it could be the case that I reincarnate for only a finite number of times or that I can reincarnate as many times as I want to)). If I spend a sufficiently large percentage of my cumulative lifespans experiencing what I consider to be sufficient pleasure and insufficient pain to call such experiences worth living instead of experiences I would rather not ever have, then any degree of suffering I might experience throughout all of my lifespans (however hellish and not what I would now consider to be worthwhile for me to experience) could be, at least in a big picture way, tolerable instead of so intolerable I would rather cease to exist as a conscious incarnated entity. In other words, I thought last night that it might be the case that I am forced to reincarnate infinitely many times and that some of my experiences inevitably include a disgusting degree of suffering but not often enough and not long enough per instance for me to seriously want to stop reincarnating or existing as a sentient information processing agent because (a) those periods of profound misery would be forgotten such that I can never develop lasting post traumatic stress disorder about them which &#8220;ruins&#8221; any experiences I have following the traumatic experiences and (b) the periods in which I assess my life as being worth experiencing and continuing to experience would be relatively long and frequent (or at least common enough for me to generalize that my life is more worthwhile for me to live than it is not worthwhile for me to life).</p>
<p>Today I had some thoughts that were somewhat related to last night&#8217;s thoughts about infinite reincarnation and necessarily selective cognition (which filters information in such a way that I am able to cope with the complexities of being instantiated in the particular configuration of lifespans I am without getting overwhelmed to a suicidal extent). I thought about how omniscience seems to be impossible to attain given what I currently understand about reality (and what I understand is that, in order for me to feel confident that I have attained omniscience, I would have to literally become that timelessly ubiquitous and irreducible substrate I referred to earlier in this note as the consciousness underlying a panpsychic reality (because such all-inclusive embodiment would enable me to perceive, simultaneously, all logic used to instantiate all abstractions which are ever rendered by any information processing machine (including the information processing machine itself because even that information processing machine is an abstraction relative to the baseline &#8220;physical&#8221; layer of reality which is a featureless yet sentient void))).</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">In order for me to know that I am omniscient (and, by definition, I would know that I am omniscient if I am omniscient), I would need to be cognizant of reality from the perspective of the root cause of all phenomena such that my understanding accounts for all manifested and logically possible configurations of matter, energy, time, and space. I would see how all manifested phenomena evolve and could evolve at every &#8220;decision point&#8221; along their respective evolutionary trajectories such that literally no instantiated or possible phenomenon is a mystery to me. I would see the inner workings of literally everything and see myself as the unified field of comprehension about all of those systems (and I might not be the only information processing machine who gets to have a glimpse (however fleeting) of actual omniscience).</span></p>
<p>I figured that, in order for any physical phenomenon to exist, that physical phenomenon must be comprised of a finite amount of space, a finite amount of time, a finite amount of matter, and a finite amount of energy. Those properties seem to need to be finite in order for the respective phenomenon to be perceptible at all. This is not to say that there cannot be an infinite number of configurations of space, time, matter, and energy across infinitely many discrete universe simulations, but in order for me to render just one of those simulations, I would need to be able to register that there are a finite number of particles and a finite distribution of ambient energy throughout that container of a simulation in order for me to see those energy and matter components evolve along N-ary tree branches (and perhaps each universe I simulate has a particular clock cycle to it which forces evolutionary events to unfold as a linear sequence of discrete steps rather than as a continuum of infinitely many formations (because each clock cycle would constrain transformations of matter and energy within the respective universe simulation to adhere to strict computational rules which are entirely known to me because I know the states of each of those finite in number entities I am simulating per clock cycle instance)).</p>
<p>The thoughts expressed in this journal entry are not what I consider to be conclusive nor particularly well organized, but I decided today that it was worthwhile for me to document them and publish them as a plain-text note within the public domain public web based collection of digital files referred to as <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/about_karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">karbytes</a>. I think that future versions of me will be grateful to have this note as a resource to look at in order to get a glimpse into what my thoughts were like during this phase of my life. I hope and expect that those future versions of karbytes who look back at this note many years from now will be more comfortable and intelligent than the version of karbytes which originated this note.
